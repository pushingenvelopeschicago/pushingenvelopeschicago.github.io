##MISSION:

>Grounded in prison abolition, Pushing Envelopes Chicago builds lgbtq+ community across bars through penpal relationships, legal aid, and re-entry support. 

##Values/Statement of Principles:
To push the envelope is a phrase that means to extend the limits of what is possible or take radical risks. We recognize and honor that surviving incarceration is a radical and transcendent risk, and every day is an incredible act of resilience, particularly for lgbtq+ people.

We are accessible to every prison and jail in Illinois for people who identify as lgbtq+ and/or are living with HIV. We believe that no one is disposable, that abolition is inextricably linked to lgbtq+ liberation, and that our work is not finished until everyone is free from all forms of imprisonment, surveillance, and punishment. 

We collaborate with other organizations in Chicago to fight against criminal registries and housing banishment laws that perpetuate homelessness and reincarceration, to support clemency campaigns and lawsuits against IDOC, and to ensure that our folks have the tools they need to survive, both while locked up and for those who are released.

##Who we are:
Pushing Envelopes Chicago is a collectively-run volunteer organization.  Our membership consists of currently incarcerated, formerly-incarcerated, system-impacted, and allied individuals with a shared commitment to building community at the intersection of incarceration and LGBTQ+ identities.


##History:
In the fall of 2012, a group of friends were finishing up a study group of ‘The New Jim Crow’ by Michelle Alexander, and were looking for a way to take action based on what they’d been learning about the prison industrial complex.  At the same time, Black & Pink National put out a call looking for hosts for the annual holiday card party.  Together, this multi-racial, mostly queer group of friends decided to host a holiday card party and organize a workshop with the Prison Industrial Complex Teaching Collective.  Over 40 people attended, 120+ cards were sent out, and the return address for the cards was listed as the housing co-op that had hosted the event.  Within a few weeks, over 60 inside members of Black & Pink in Illinois had written back, asking for continued correspondence and an array of requests for support & solidarity.  

The small group of free-world friends began convening monthly meetings to read and respond to incoming mail, begin matching more pen-pals, and ultimately determine how best to respond to the clear desire from inside Black & Pink members for more queer & trans abolitionist support.  These meetings were attended by the early members of what would become the Black & Pink Chicago chapter, along with key people and groups involved in LGBTQ prison abolition work in Chicago and elsewhere. 

At the Chicago Dyke March in 2013, we formally launched our Chicago Chapter of Black & Pink, by marching together with a “Fuck Prisons” banner, distributing postcards recruiting new pen-pals, and inviting people to an upcoming film screening.  That summer, we began hosting weekly mail nights on Monday nights at the housing co-op to read and respond to incoming mail, and met twice per month as a chapter to determine more of our strategy and structure as free-world members of Black & Pink Chicago.  We created working groups in an attempt to hold down the various pieces of work that were being asked of us, including political education, mail processing, pen-pal matching, advocacy, and eventually re-entry.

In the early months and even years, we struggled with how to develop systems and processes that would allow us to meet the overwhelming needs for support being asked of us, as an all volunteer group, with still relatively under-defined goals but giant hearts and visions.  We struggled with how to balance our desires to do outside organizing and political education with the very urgent and crisis-driven demands coming from inside members experiencing the violence and trauma of incarceration first-hand.  We struggled with race and class and power and how to share responsibilities and hold each other accountable, when we were taking on enormous workloads without necessarily providing training or onboarding for new people or ourselves.  But we continued to try to do the messy, needed work of building inside/outside relationships, and striving for the abolitionist commitments we’ve made to show up for each other and refuse the violent isolation that prisons impose on our communities.
In 2022, Black & Pink Chicago decided unanimously to part from Black & Pink National. This decision was not made lightly, and was the result of many months of deliberation and feedback from inside members and formerly incarcerated members, and overall long-term independence and lack of support from the national chapter.

We are indebted to the hundreds of volunteers who made the work of Black & Pink Chicago possible over the years and are honored to carry it forward into a new generation as Pushing Envelopes Chicago. We are armed with our lessons learned, our passion for transformation, and our ongoing love and solidarity with our family on the inside.  

Once there were no prisons.  That day will come again.

##OUR WORK:

##MAIL PROCESSING:
Our mail processing working group, known affectionately as Fam Mail, is where the magic happens. Members meet weekly to sort all incoming mail, enter new members into the database, respond to inquiries for support or penpals, forward mail onto the rest of us, and hold a consistent meeting space for newly released members to come in-person and say hello. Letters come from existing inside family, new folks inquiring about membership, people seeking advocacy from outside members, artists sending us drawings, and more. We also coordinate birthday cards each month for all of our inside members. 

Fam mail hosts an open meeting every Monday, 6-9pm
656 W Barry, Chicago IL 60657

##PST:
Penpal Support Team serves two major functions:
Coordinate regular in-person and virtual penpal matching events to get free world folks matched to our inside family who are requesting penpals. Inside penpals send us introduction letters, which we log in the database and bring to matching events. Free world people get to look through the letters at each matching and choose a penpal. PST also provides a brief introduction at each matching event, including a Prison Abolition 101 and some best practices and guidelines for writing someone who is currently incarcerated.
PST provides ongoing support for free world penpals as they navigate any joys and challenges that may arise while corresponding. We want to make sure you feel confident and have the tools you need to maintain a healthy relationship with your new friend! 

Correspondence with our inside family is the heart and soul of our work. As one of our free world penpals said about writing and visiting their inside penpal: "To be a lifeline: Last month my friend and I visited her pen-pal who's serving a life sentence at a maximum security facility in Illinois. He looked us in the eyes and told us that we absolutely could not understand how important it is to be a pen-pal to someone on the inside. The mental gymnastics that he goes through to maintain his sense of self while confined to a cell 23 hours per day is, quite frankly, unimaginable to those of us who have not experienced incarceration. He didn't come out of the womb intending to spend the rest of his life behind bars, he told us, and needs love just like any other human. He told us our letters are his lifeline. We were his only visitors all year."

What:
Pushing Envelope Chicago’s Re-Entry working group supports and builds community with formerly incarcerated members while they navigate the parole or release process. We provide small scale as-needed financial support for housing, utility and phone bills, transportation, gender affirming clothes and hygiene products, food and more. We also help with resource navigation and collaborate with like minded organizations to ensure our folks connect to affirming and appropriate resources. We aim to provide this support while eliminating the institutional barriers of traditional nonprofits, instead truly meeting each person where they are at, and building a loving and supportive community.

Who:
Our re-entry working group is located in Chicago and predominantly supports people being released in and around Chicago, but is open to short-term resource navigation for people anywhere in Illinois. We support anyone currently incarcerated and nearing their parole release date, or formerly incarcerated in and around Chicago, who identifies as lgbtq+, who is living with HIV, and/or is required to register due to a sex offense on their background. We recognize the unique challenges that people on the registry face during the parole and re-entry process, as well as the homophobia and transphobia built into registry laws, and are committed to doing whatever we can to support. 

How:
We apply for a few microgrants with the financial support of our fiscal sponsor, Diverse & Resilient. Currently, we have small grants thanks to Resist, Julian Grace, and Crossroads. Outside of grants, we independently fundraise through a patreon. [insert all the links here?]

Impact:
In 2021, the Re-entry Working Group supported over 25 people exiting prison and fundraised over $20k in direct support: 
$3.7k on bus passes & transportation
$10k+ on rent
$1.6k on hotels & emergency housing
$3.5k on gift cards for clothing & necessities
$1.4k on misc. bills & emergency needs
